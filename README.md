# Active_Building_Model
In our endeavour to conduct accurate and realistic research into the cyber security of an Active Building environment, we design and built a model of an active building that would encompass key systems that could be scaled down but keep a similar level of functionality allowing for testing and scenarios to be conducted with results and outcomes being of a similar nature to the full-scale counterpart. The AB model focuses on a singular floor but includes both base build system (landlord) and fit out system (tenet), meaning the simulation is not locked to one floor and if need be additional floors could be added and adjusted for different scenarios. In addition to the modularity both system works independently but can share information on usage from the singular offices such as flow metering and HVAC cooling and heating requests. For this model we also took the liberty to incorporate multiple network technologies into the building including ethernet, Wi-Fi, LoRa (If signal permitting) and the option for 5G to be added later. This document will outline the functions present in the systems and how base build and fit out systems are system of systems and what that means in the form of data transition and control over these sub-systems.
